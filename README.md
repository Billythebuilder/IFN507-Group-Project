# 1. Summary of Key Information
GroupWork: This assignment is a group-of-three project. You may form your own group and
enroll your group on Canvas. Your group members can be from different practicals sessions.

If you do not have a group or do not enroll your group on Canvas by the end of Week 9
(Sunday 22 Sep 2024), you will be assigned to a random group.

Due Date: 23:59 Friday 25 Oct 2024.


Submission by 23:59 Sunday 27 Oct 2024 is acceptable without any academic penalty.

Extension: Any extensions should be requested online directly to the faculty.

Weighting: This assessment is worth 30% of your total grade for this unit. All group members
will receive the same grade for this assessment unless a request is received by the teaching
team for special considerations, e.g., of an inactive group member.

Task: Group Written Report. Write your report in our provided template, which is available on
Canvas.

Length of Report: Your report should be three to four (3 – 4) pages long, i.e., not less than three
(3) pages and not more than four (4) pages in length. This page limit excludes your cover
page and any references.
You are required to use the provided template and fill in the requested information in appropriate
sections.

It is not a requirement to include any graphics or screenshots in your report.

Template Requirements: There are instructions included on the cover page of the provided template.
Read these instructions carefully and ensure you understand them. When completing
this assignment task, you should use the instructions in the template, the instructions in this
document, and the direction provided by the marking criteria document. Do NOT alter the
format of the template in any aspects, such as page margins, headings, font, font size, and
adding/removing sections. Thus, deleting any sections or section headings for more space
from the template is NOT acceptable. This assignment is based on a page count rather than
a word count, so make sure that the page and document structure are not compromised.
Each answer box in the template has a variable size, so you can provide more information
or less information for each of the questions, based on your own discretion. You should use
1 the marking criteria to guide you in this. Typically, a higher weighted section would warrant
a longer response than a section with fewer overall marks.

How to submit: Submit an assignment report via Canvas. Your report should be in .pdf, .docx,
or .doc format.

# ONE and Only ONE of your group members submits your assignment report on behalf of the whole group.

Multiple times of submissions are allowed from a group before the due date. But only the
last submission before the due date will be marked.
Contribution Statement: You must complete the ‘Contribution Statement’ section on the cover
page of the template. Each of your group members should provide a concise summary of
your contribution to the group project. It is expected that all group members contribute to
the project. A group member who is inactive or does not provide a Contribution Statement
will not be awarded any marks.




# 2. Project Scenario
You work for a company that has a high-availability requirement for its computer network and network
services. You are asked to investigate a problem with a File Server on your company’s network.
It has been determined that some sort of network security incident has occurred. As a result of the
incident, all users are not able to access the network.
You decide to examine a sample of network traffic from the file server using Wireshark. The
capture file is named IFN507 ProjectCaptureFile.pcap, which is available from the assignment project
folder on Canvas. From this capture file and your own research, you need to determine what sort of
attack has occurred and then provide mitigation strategies to prevent it from happening again. You
can assume that there are no or inadequate security provisions in place on the company’s network.
Analyse the capture file, conduct some research, and report your findings in the provided template.
Please note: This is only a small sample of the actual traffic from the impacted machine. You can
assume that the traffic not provided would follow the same patterns and exhibit the same behaviors as
seen in the provided sample.



# 3. Assignment Task
This is a group assessment. Each group is a team of three (3) students. You are asked to analyse the
capture file and carry out your own research to determine the cause of the interrupted service. Report
your findings using the template provided. Your assignment tasks include:
  Conduct research and describe the normal expected behaviour of the Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP);
  Identify any anomalous behaviour or patterns within the provided capture file;
  Identify the impacted TCP header fields using specific packet examples from the capture file;
  Identify any other instances of anomalous or noteworthy behavior in other layers, if applicable,
and provide specific packet examples from the capture file;
  From the above investigation, identify and explain what type of attack has likely occurred;and
  Provide mitigation strategies to prevent this from occurring in the future. Explain both the
benefits and limitations of your recommended strategies.


# 4. Individual Contribution
It is expected that all team members contribute equally and meaningfully to this assessment. Do not
wait until the last minute to contact your team members.
If you have been trying to contact a team member and have received no response, please keep a
record of this. If they have not responded or contributed by week 11, you can exclude them from your
group by claiming their contribution as 0% on your final submission. You must claim your individual
contribution in the table provided in the template. Please be concise in your contribution statement.
Non-contributing team members will not be awarded any marks.


# 5. Report Submission
Your team should submit an electronic copy of your completed report for marking by the due date.
The format of your report should be .pdf or .docx. Submission for final marking is through the Canvas;
look for the submission link for the report. Only ONE member of the team should submit the report.
Be sure you have decided on who will submit and confirm with your team-mate before the deadline.
You can submit your report multiple times, but only the last submission before the due date will be
graded.
Submission by email will NOT be accepted.


# 6. Marking Criteria
This assessment task is worth 30%. The marking criteria document outlines the criteria you will be
assessed against. This is a separate document released together with this specification document. Use
this criteria document as a guide when working on the assessment. You should self- assess your work
prior to submission using the marking criteria.


# 7. Teamwork
This assessment task requires that you work in a team of three (3) students. This increases discussion
opportunities and perhaps leads to exploring ideas that may not have otherwise occurred to you as an
individual. However, as in any relationship, working together may become difficult if group members
have very different expectations regarding the assessment. Some difficulties may be avoided by
discussing expectations with team-mates BEFORE starting work together.
Here is a list of ideas you may want to discuss with your team-mates. There may be other ideas
that are also important to you. If you discuss these honestly before you start, then you know where
you stand, and what can help make your teamwork more effective.
Ask your team-mates about these questions:
1) What are you hoping to achieve for this unit/assessment item? If one person is working for a
high distinction and the other is happy with a pass, then there may be some conflict about the
standard of the submission. Understand your team-mates’ goal for this assessment task and be
honest about your goal. Try to sort out the areas where you can each contribute to best effect.
2) How much time do you have available to work on this – when and where?
We all have lives outside of university, and it can be challenging to coordinate times for different
activities. Here are some questions you might ask your team-mates:
  Are you a full-time student, or are you working full time and studying part time?
  Do you have commitments (for example: work, sporting, family, or religious commitments)
that will impact on your availability?
  Are you able to work on this during the day, at night, or over the weekend?
  How will we meet (Zoom? Teams? Facetime?) and how often? How much can you do
independently between meetings?
  Are there considerations that need to be made regarding time zones? Some group members
may be currently traveling interstate or overseas due to whatever reasons.
3) What are your skills or strengths?
Are you good at:
  Data analysis, with technical knowledge of the networking protocols?
  Tracking down information from a range of sources, summarizing information, and finding
great examples to illustrate the points you make?
  The write-up phase: writing clearly and concisely?
  Citation and referencing?
You do not need to be good at all these aspects to form a great report writing team. It can be very
useful to have team-mates whose strengths complement yours, so that together you form an effective
team.


# 8. Academic Integrity
This assessment contains elements of both analysis and research. You are expected to consult suitable
academic and authoritative sources such as journal articles, conference proceedings, textbooks,
and other authoritative industry sources on networking and security. When obtaining information
from web sources that are not academic in nature, ensure that the organisation is reputable and is
an authority on the topic. Do NOT reference lecture slides, lecture/practical recordings, or practical
worksheets.
Use the QUT APA style for referencing and citations with further information available at https:
//www.citewrite.qut.edu.au/cite/qutcite.html#apa-general. Citations must
be in-text with the full reference list to be provided in Section four (4) of the template.
You should write your assignment report in your own words. As such simply copy-pasting from
sources into your report without proper attribution is considered plagiarism. QUT has rules and
policies to deal with plagiarism, and cheating in assessment in general. If plagiarism is suspected, the
Unit Coordinator must notify the Faculty Academic Integrity Committee. The penalties imposed may
be severe (See the QUT MOPP for details).
9. Marking Criteria
A marking guide with detailed criteria and requirements is enclosed in a separate document.
